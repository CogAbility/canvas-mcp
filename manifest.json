For each formative assignment that has a due date before today:\n   - Use the get-rubric-statistics tool to get detailed statistics\n   - Include the point distribution to create visualizations\n   - Skip assignments with future due dates\n\n4. Create and analyze two comprehensive visualizations that show all assignments together:\n   a) Grouped Stacked Bar Chart:\n      - X-axis: Criteria names\n      - Y-axis: Percentage of students\n      - Groups: One group of stacked bars per assignment\n      - Bars: Stacked to show score distribution (0-4 points)\n      - Colors: Consistent colors across assignments for each point value\n      - Legend: Include both assignment names and point values\n      \n   b) Grouped Bar Chart:\n      - X-axis: Criteria names\n      - Y-axis: Average score\n      - Groups: One bar per assignment for each criterion\n      - Colors: Different color for each assignment\n      - Include error bars showing standard deviation if available\n\n5. Provide a summary of key insights based on:\n   - Score distributions across criteria and assignments\n   - Progression or patterns between assignments\n   - Common areas of strength or difficulty across assignments\n   - Notable trends or changes between assignments\n   - Specific criteria that show consistent or varying performance\n\nPlease ensure all visualizations are clearly labeled with:\n- Descriptive title (including analysis date)\n- Axis labels\n- Legend showing assignments and score levels\n- Clear distinction between assignments\n- Percentage or count indicators where appropriate"
